## Change sticky action key

- If you're not using mic for a sticky key, but some other action key, and you still want it to look like Gboard mic, see small guide how to change it in `Steps`.
- For better context, see Florisboard issue [#2330](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/issues/2330) where point <sup>`2`</sup> is

### Steps

- Open the theme you want to edit in theme editor
- Scroll to "**Smartbar Action Key**" where is `code = [-233]` (that's a mic key code)
- Press edit icon ‚úèÔ∏è | `01`
- In "**Target key codes**" press on plus sign ‚ûï | `02`
- Type in the code key you set for the sticky key. If you don't know which one it is, click on the magnifying glass icon üîç, which should be flashing now, indicating that you are in 'key recording' mode. Then, press the key whose code you want to find out, for example, incognito | `03`
- When you select the desired key, press "**Add**" | `04`
- You should now have two keycodes. Press `-233` to open a pop-up to remove the mic design | `05`
- Press "**Delete**" | `06`
- Press "**Apply**" to apply design to your selected sticky key | `07`
